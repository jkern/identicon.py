I like identicons, and I like python.

According to [wikipedia][1] there's an implementation of the identicon code
in python, but the authors site is down.

> Identicon in Python: On February 3, 2007, (dda or dbvic) made available "a 
> functioning Identicon lib in Python.

While I don't think that this code is the same referenced I did [find the current
 code in a trac repo][2]. 

I believe I [found the link][3] that the wikipedia entry suggests. But the
source code link is broken.

So to sum it up. I don't know if this code is maintained. But I know that I like it.

I am not the original author, but I'll be maintaining it as best I can.
